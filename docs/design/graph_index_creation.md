# ApeRAG Graph Index Creation Process Technical Documentation

## Overview

The ApeRAG Graph Index creation process is the core pipeline of the entire knowledge graph construction system, responsible for transforming raw documents into structured knowledge graphs. This process is based on the LightRAG framework with extensive refactoring and optimization.

### Technical Improvements Overview

The original LightRAG has numerous limitations: non-stateless design leading to global state management concurrency conflicts, lack of effective concurrency control mechanisms, storage layer stability and consistency issues, and coarse-grained locking affecting performance. **Most critically, the original LightRAG does not support data isolation - all collection nodes and edges are stored in the same global space, causing data conflicts and pollution between different users and projects, making true multi-tenant support impossible**.

We have conducted large-scale refactoring to address these issues:
- **Complete rewrite to stateless architecture**: Each task uses independent instances, completely resolving concurrency conflicts
- **Introduced workspace data isolation mechanism**: Each collection has independent data space, completely solving data conflicts and pollution
- **Self-developed Concurrent Control model**: Implementing fine-grained lock management for high concurrency processing
- **Optimized lock granularity**: From coarse-grained global locks to entity-level and relationship-level precise locking
- **Refactored storage layer**: Support for Neo4j, PostgreSQL and other graph database backends, implementing reliable multi-storage consistency guarantees
- **Connected component concurrency optimization**: Intelligent concurrency strategy based on graph topology analysis

The Graph Index creation process includes the following core stages:
1. **Task reception and instance creation**: Celery task scheduling, LightRAG instance initialization
2. **Document chunking processing**: Intelligent chunking algorithms maintaining semantic coherence
3. **Entity relationship extraction**: LLM-based entity and relationship identification
4. **Connected component analysis**: Topological analysis of entity relationship networks
5. **Grouped concurrent processing**: Processing by connected components to improve performance
6. **Node edge merging**: Entity deduplication, relationship aggregation, description summarization
7. **Multi-storage writing**: Consistent writing to vector databases and graph databases

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Stateless Architecture Refactoring

The original LightRAG uses global state management, leading to severe concurrency conflicts, with multiple tasks sharing the same instance causing data pollution. **More seriously, all collection graph data is stored in the same global namespace, where entities and relationships from different projects interfere with each other**, making true multi-tenant isolation impossible.

We completely rewrote LightRAG's instance management code, implementing a stateless design: each Celery task creates an independent LightRAG instance, achieving collection-level data isolation through the `workspace` parameter. **Each collection's graph data is stored in independent namespaces** (e.g., `entity:{entity_name}:{workspace}`), supporting Neo4j, PostgreSQL and other graph database backends, with strict instance lifecycle management to ensure no resource leaks.

### 2. Staged Pipeline Processing

**Document processing and graph indexing separation**:
- **ainsert_and_chunk_document**: Responsible for document chunking and storage
- **aprocess_graph_indexing**: Responsible for graph index construction
- **Advantages**: Modular design, easy to test and maintain

### 3. Connected Component Concurrency Optimization

The original LightRAG lacks effective concurrency strategies, with simple global locks causing performance bottlenecks and inability to fully utilize multi-core CPU resources.

We designed a connected component discovery algorithm based on graph theory, decomposing entity relationship networks into independent processing components. Through topology analysis-driven intelligent grouped concurrency, different connected components can be processed completely in parallel, achieving zero lock conflict design.

The core algorithm approach is: construct adjacency graphs of entity relationships, use BFS traversal to discover all connected components, group entities belonging to different connected components into independent processing tasks, thus achieving true parallel processing.

### 4. Fine-grained Concurrency Control Mechanism

The original LightRAG lacks effective concurrency control mechanisms, with storage operation consistency unable to be guaranteed, frequently experiencing data races and deadlock issues.

We implemented a Concurrent Control model from scratch, establishing a fine-grained lock manager that supports precise locking at entity and relationship levels. Lock naming uses workspace isolation design: `entity:{entity_name}:{workspace}` and `relationship:{src}:{tgt}:{workspace}`. We designed intelligent lock strategies, only locking during merge writes, completely lock-free during entity extraction stages, and preventing deadlocks through sorted lock acquisition mechanisms to avoid circular waiting.

## Specific Execution Pipeline Example

### Complete Graph Index Creation Process

Taking a single document's graph index creation as an example, the entire processing pipeline includes the following key stages:

1. **Task Reception Layer**: Celery tasks receive Graph index creation requests, calling LightRAG Manager

2. **LightRAG Manager Layer**: Create independent LightRAG instances for each task, ensuring stateless processing

3. **Document Chunking Stage**:
   - Content cleaning and preprocessing
   - Intelligent chunking based on token count (supporting overlap)
   - Generate unique chunk IDs and metadata
   - Serial writing to vector storage and text storage

4. **Graph Index Construction Stage**:
   - Call LLM for concurrent entity relationship extraction
   - Connected component analysis and grouping processing
   - Statistical extraction results

5. **Entity Relationship Extraction Stage**:
   - Build LLM prompt templates
   - Use semaphores to control concurrency
   - Support optional gleaning extraction
   - Parse extraction results into structured data

6. **Connected Component Grouping Processing**:
   - Discover connected components and create processing tasks
   - Filter entities and relationships belonging to each component
   - Use semaphores to control component concurrent processing

7. **Node Edge Merging Stage**:
   - Collect same-named entities and same-direction relationships
   - Use fine-grained locks for concurrent merging
   - Synchronously update graph database and vector database

### Data Flow Transformation Process Analysis

#### 🚀 **Document Input → Structured Chunking**
Raw documents undergo format cleaning and noise filtering, using intelligent chunking algorithms to segment according to semantic boundaries and token limits, generating chunk collections with unique identifiers and metadata. This step ensures data quality and traceability for subsequent processing.

#### 🔬 **Chunk Data → AI Extraction Results** 
Chunk data undergoes intelligent analysis through LLM concurrent calls, simultaneously identifying entities (people, organizations, concepts, etc.) and semantic relationships between entities in the text. This stage produces raw, undeduped entity and relationship lists, providing raw materials for subsequent graph construction.

#### 🧠 **Extraction Results → Topology Grouping**
Based on extracted entity relationships, adjacency graph networks are constructed, using BFS algorithms to discover connected components and identify groups of mutually related entities. For example: technology team-related entities form one group, finance department-related entities form another group. This topology analysis lays the foundation for parallel processing.

#### ⚡ **Topology Grouping → Intelligent Merging**
Different connected components can be processed completely in parallel, with same-named entities undergoing intelligent deduplication and information aggregation, and same-direction relationships undergoing weight accumulation and description merging. This process integrates fragmented information into complete knowledge units.

#### 📝 **Merged Data → Content Optimization**
Length checks are performed on merged entity and relationship descriptions, with overly long content undergoing intelligent summary compression through LLM, ensuring a balance between information density and storage efficiency. Short content is retained directly, while long content is intelligently summarized.

#### 💾 **Optimized Content → Multi-dimensional Storage**
Final knowledge content is written simultaneously to multiple storage systems:
- **Graph Database**: Stores entity nodes and relationship edges, supporting graph queries
- **Vector Database**: Stores semantic vectors, supporting similarity search
- **Text Storage**: Retains original chunks, supporting full-text search

This multi-dimensional storage architecture ensures optimal performance of knowledge graphs in different query scenarios.

### Data Flow Optimization Features

#### 1. Fine-grained Concurrency Control
We implemented precise locking mechanisms at entity and relationship levels: `entity:{entity_name}:{workspace}` and `relationship:{src}:{tgt}:{workspace}`, minimizing lock scope to only during merge writes, with completely parallel entity extraction stages. Through sorted lock acquisition order, we effectively prevent circular waiting and deadlocks.

#### 2. Connected Component-driven Concurrency Optimization
We designed topology analysis based on BFS algorithms, discovering independent entity relationship networks and grouping them for parallel processing. Different connected components are processed completely independently, achieving zero lock competition, while processing in batches by component effectively controls memory peaks.

#### 3. Intelligent Data Merging Strategy
We implemented intelligent entity deduplication based on entity_name, supporting intelligent concatenation and summarization of multiple description fragments, quantitative accumulation of relationship strength, and established complete data lineage recording mechanisms.

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Connected Component Optimization

**Topology-driven Concurrency Strategy**:
- **Independent Processing**: Different connected components processed completely in parallel

- **Memory Efficiency**: Batch processing by component, controlling memory usage

The system automatically collects connected component distribution statistics, including total components, maximum component size, average component size, single-entity component count, and large component count, for performance tuning and resource allocation.

### 2. LLM Call Optimization

**Batch Processing and Caching Strategy**:
- **Concurrency Control**: Use semaphores to limit concurrent LLM calls
- **Batch Optimization**: Batch processing of similar content
- **Caching Mechanism**: Reuse of entity description summary caching

The system intelligently checks description length, automatically calling LLM to generate summaries when exceeding token thresholds, supporting summary result caching reuse for improved efficiency.

### 3. Storage Write Optimization

**Batch Writing and Connection Reuse**:
- **Batch Operations**: Reduce database round trips
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Async Writing**: Parallel writing to different storage systems

### 4. Memory Management Optimization

**Streaming Processing and Memory Control**:
- **Chunk Processing**: Streaming chunking of large documents
- **Timely Release**: Immediate memory release after processing completion
- **Monitoring Alerts**: Memory usage monitoring
