LightRAG Module for ApeRAG

This module is based on the original LightRAG project with extensive modifications.

Original Project:
- Repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG
- Paper: "LightRAG: Simple and Fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (arXiv:2410.05779)
- Authors: Zirui Guo, Lianghao Xia, Yanhua Yu, Tu Ao, Chao Huang
- License: MIT License

Modifications by ApeRAG Team:
- Removed global state management for true concurrent processing
- Added stateless interfaces for Celery/Prefect integration
- Implemented instance-level locking mechanism
- Enhanced error handling and stability
- See changelog.md for detailed modifications
